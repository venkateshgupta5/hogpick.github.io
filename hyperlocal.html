<h2>What is Hyper-Local e-commerce?</h2><br>

<p>According to the 2011 census, India has 53 urban centers with a population of over 1 million. Our cities are among the fastest growing in the world. But the growth in Indian cities is chaotic. The commuting time in these cities has become enormous. With the trend of a nuclear family and working couples, hardly anyone has time. And many don't want to take the pain to commute in traffic, stand in queues and buy day to day commodities.</p>

Hence, players emerged in the market who would deliver groceries and food products to you, right at your doorstep. And this is what hyperlocal e-commerce is.<br><br>
<center><img class="img-responsive img-blog" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQGdjmETTjZgVw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1593648000&v=beta&t=vr4wBIPyj6IMqc5Q9lgtq3ohPTMDBw2fREavjFxnPzc" alt="Smiley face"></center>

<h2>But why Hyper Local? How is it different from traditional e-commerce?</h2>

<p>In e-commerce; picking of goods would normally be from a warehouse and then shipped and delivered but in hyperlocal e-commerce, the deliverable is picked and shipped within the same cluster. (A cluster is a small geographical location)</p>

<p>Groceries and food items constitute 70-80% of total retail sales in India. And by 2019, e-commerce only has a share of 4.8% of the total retail. Hyperlocal e-commerce initially focused on leveraging the best of both; the stock of, offline retail and service of online retail.</p>
In Principle Model of Hyper-Local e-commerce<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Offline retailers (groceries and food outlets) have a fixed operational cost and a lot of capital is lost in perishable goods that turn out as waste. They were readily happy to share margin if there sales increase. </li><br>
<li>The e-commerce companies should ideally charge a fee for customer's convenience and instant delivery. Instacart, US-based hyper-local e-commerce; charges a premium and surge delivery charges to its customers depending on the demand for delivery. If a customer doesn't want to pay a fee; he/she is free to commute, stand in queues and buy commodities. </li></ul>
<p><br><br>
<center<img class="img-responsive img-blog" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQHxBXyc2Z34rA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1593648000&v=beta&t=rTQgoUHu1u7IMRU-ab1iFfKw2-JSQmcCfcYNiz6b4MQ" alt="Smiley face"></p>

This Price ++ model doesn't seem to fit well in the Indian scenario. Indian, hyperlocal companies were standing against local 'Kirana' store and they adopted 'discounting' strategy for customer acquisition.
Crash of Hyper-Local 1.0.

<p><br>The first phase of hyperlocal e-commerce hoped to acquire customers by offering discount and planned to stop it at some point in time. When they stopped offering discounts; new funded players came in, who aggressively pitched for discounts. It created a black hole that had had no end. Investors upon realizing this started to tighten their purse.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Heavily funding startups as LocalBanya and Pepper Tap failed. </li>
    <li>Flipkart closed its grocery delivery app Nearby and Ola had to shut his hyper-local delivery service Ola Store.</li></ul>

<h2>What were the other reasons why hyperlocal e-commerce hit back in 2016?</h2>

    <ul><li>Modest Capacity Utilisation</li></ul>
Hyperlocal players were competing against local Kirana delivery agent who had maximum capacity utilization. The delivery agent rides on a bicycle delivers only when the owner feels he has no work and is paid around Rs. 4000-6000. On the other hand, hyperlocal logistics has a high demand in peak hours and abysmally low demand in odd hours; hitting back the capacity utilization.
<br><br>
    <ul><li>Unrealistic Business Model </li></ul>

In the thrill of the startup, hyperlocal players totally overlooked the margin they were earning.  PepperTap, a hyperlocal grocery store that failed in 2016 had expanded to 21 cities and 20,000 deliveries within 17 months. Exciting! isn't it?; but exaggerated marketing and discount with a nominal margin sucked out all the venture capital instead of reaping any revenue out of the startup. PepperTap lost approximately Rs. 200/ order. Given that their sales were around 20,000 per day, the loss was 40,00,000 INR per day at that time.  <br><br>
<ul><li>
    High Logistics and Technological Cost </li></ul>


The biker based delivery model isn't sustainable for low value/low item goods. The technology to maintain logistics operation is very costly.

<br><br>

   <ul><li> Quick Scale </li></ul>

You need to be performing the best quality work at all times. Scaling too fast can hit your brand; if not executed properly. Quick scale turns out to be a recipe for failure for Indian hyperlocal e-commerce companies.<br><br>

   <ul><li> High customer acquisition cost and fierce competition were some other reasons. </li></ul>
<br>
<h2>Inventory based model Vs Marketplace based model</h2>
One of the main reasons why Bigbasket survived the 2016 hyperlocal crash was that it didn't rely on market place based model. Same day scheduled delivery was built in its business model which allowed customers to fill the cart over time; increasing the items per basket and in turn their margins.<br><br>
<center><img class="img-responsive img-blog" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQEQGj6XKFpFeA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1593648000&v=beta&t=CxWpDqtb9el1CxQLz_LGjg2gz_P8YU1XTHPnZ6p9Jgs" alt="Smiley face" scale=70%></p></center>

Groffers started off with a marketplace based business model. Once the order was placed by a customer, it would pick up goods from a neighborhood grocer listed on its platform, and deliver it within 90 minutes. It did not hold inventory, did not have warehouses and did not manage the supply chain. Groffers had to undergo a transformation as the model wasn't sustainable to scale.
<h2>The emergence of hyperlocal 2.0</h2>

<h3>“Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning.” - Albert Einstein</h3><br>
<center><img class="img-responsive img-blog" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQGafW4AuAxEhA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1593648000&v=beta&t=cWWEEFEMwnEswA6xUDGlrVkSbR4vczpY3wZHF13yfB8" alt="Smiley face" scale=70%></p></center>

<ul>
    <li>
    The hyperlocal players have realized that they can't make money by delivering grocery goods to customers in 90 minutes. The model isn't sustainable.</li><br>
    <li>Many startups like Milkbasket have proven their business model by managing their unit economics well. There understanding of consumer behavior has become more nuanced. This has again excited not just investors but e-commerce and food delivery companies.</li></ul>
<br>
<h2>Future Trends</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Hyperlocal e-commerce involves too many bits and pieces, unlike e-commerce where you have a warehouse and have to ensure proper logistics. In the hyperlocal segment, there won't be only one winner. Smaller players can also come and do well in a highly specialized vertical.</li></ul>
    <br>
    <ul><li>Big players wouldn't prefer to build in-house but rather let small players build and acquire later.</li></ul>
